- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
  I think encapsulation makes the code much more concise and easier to write and read. Probably this would lessen the errors from this code. Also, as the encapsulation forms more structural code, when writing complicated and multi-interactive code, it would help me to efficiently form the program.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  Most of my codes worked, but I wasn't quite sure how to test all the codes and check if it wouldn't make errors in the case of exceptions. I would give an advice to try considering all the probable cases of potential errors and prevent in advance.
